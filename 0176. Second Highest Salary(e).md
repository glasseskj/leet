Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
```sql
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
```sql
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```
選兩次max，這樣第二次就可以排除第一次的結果

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee
where Salary < (select max(Salary) from Employee)
```
