Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```
選兩次max，這樣第二次就可以排除第一次的結果

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee
where Salary < (select max(Salary) from Employee)
```
方法2(仍有錯誤)
原先打算用rank排序再找第二高的，不過總是有幾個判斷錯誤，還是方法一實在，二就留作參考
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select ifnull
(
    (
        select Salary as SecondHighestSalary 
        from
        (
            select a1.Salary,count(a2.Salary) "rank" from Employee as a1,Employee as a2
            where a1.Salary >= a2.Salary
            GROUP BY a2.Salary
        ) a3
        where a3.rank=2
    ),null
) as SecondHighestSalary



```
