Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):
```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```
標準的排名，rank也可以當成算該分數輸給幾個分數，一個分數拿來，與原表單比較(a1,a2)，統計共有(count)多少分數高於該分數，同分數只需算一次(distinct)

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below 
select a1.Score,count(a2.Score) "Rank" from Scores as a1,(select distinct(Score) "Score" from Scores) as a2
where a1.Score <= a2.Score
group by a1.id
order by a1.Score desc
```
